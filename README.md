## My process

### Built with

1. **Frontend**: 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

2.  **Server side**

* Express framework
* Mongo

3. **Concepts**

* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow
* Backend architecture - hybrid architecture
* Database architecture

### What I learned

Skills I have applied:

1. Implementing a design to a code base
2. Basic HTML knowledge and layout including semantics
3. Use of flexbox in layout using CSS
4. Use of custom properties in CSS
5. Manipulation of DOM using Javascript
6. Application of Fetch API in updating the client side content
7. Persistent UI(dark/light mode) by using the browser tehcnologies available eg.localstorage
8. Applying NodeJS in the backend server with express framework
9. Organise the modules as per each specific purpose eg routers and controllers
10. Use of templating technologies i.e. ejs for dynamic applications
11. Design data storage layout in for ease of querying
12. Using non-relational databases
13. Creating, Reading, Updating and deleting data using non-relational database
14. Using version Control in keeping up to date with the changes of the development
15. Deployment of a fullstack application


**Other learnings**

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
